nodejs-dnsimple
===============

This is an unofficial DNSimple API module for node.js.
You need a DNSimple account to use this.

[API documentation](http://developer.dnsimple.com/)


Installation
------------

Stable: `npm install dnsimple`

Develop: `npm install fvdm/nodejs-dnsimple#develop`


Example
-------

See _Configuration_ below for details.


```js
var dnsimple = new require('dnsimple')({ email: 'you@web.tld', token: 'abc123' });

// Add a domain name
var input = {
  domain: { name: 'example.tld' }
};

dnsimple( 'POST', '/domains', input, function( err, domain ) {
  if( err ) {
    return console.log( err );
  }
  console.log( domain.name +' created with ID '+ domain.id );
});
```


Authentication
--------------

This module supports multiple authentication methods.
None of them is totally secure, but some are easier to reset.


### Account token

Most secure, easy to reset at [dnsimple.com/account](https://dnsimple.com/account).


```js
require('dnsimple')({ email: 'your@email.tld', token: '12345abcde' })
```


### Email & password

```js
require('dnsimple')({ email: 'your@email.tld', password: 'secret' })
```


### Domain token

Access to only one domain name, easy to reset.

```js
require('dnsimple')({ domainToken: 'abc123' })
```


### Two-factor authentication (2FA / OTP)

When you have set up two-factor authentication for your account the module returns
error `twoFactorOTP missing` when you did not provide your one-time password.

First your need to tell the API _once_ your one-time code from Authy or SMS, by
defining it during setup along with your `email` and `password` and calling a random
method. Then the API returns a token which you can use instead of your email and password.


```js
// Set the OTP code on load
var dnsimple = require('dnsimple')({
  email: 'my@mail.tld',
  password: 'my-secret',
  twoFactorOTP: '0123456'
});

// Now call a random method to trade the OTP for a longterm token
dnsimple( 'GET', '/subscription', function( err, data, meta ) {
  if( err ) { return console.log(err) }
  console.log( 'Two-factor token: '+ meta.twoFactorToken );
});

// From now on only use this token - no email/password
var dnsimple = require('dnsimple')({
  twoFactorToken: '22596363b3de40b06f981fb85d82312e'
});
```


Configuration
-------------

When loading the module into your code you need to provide an _Object_ for
authentication as described above.
This object can have a few more settings.

name        | description                           | default
------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------
email       | Account email address                 |
token       | Account access token                  |
password    | Account password                      |
domainToken | Domain specific API access token      |
timeout     | End API call after this amount of ms  | 5000
hostname    | API endpoint                          | api.dnsimple.com


To use the [sandbox](http://developer.dnsimple.com/sandbox/) environment
set `hostname` to `api.sandbox.dnsimple.com`.


dnsimple ( method, path, [params], callback )
--------

The module is only one method which takes care of all the error handling
and basic post-processing.

See the [API documentation](http://developer.dnsimple.com/) for details on each method.


#### Module Arguments

name     | type     | required | description
---------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------
method   | string   | yes      | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
path     | string   | yes      | i.e. `/domains`
params   | object   | no       | i.e. `{domain: { name: 'one.com' } }`
callback | function | yes      | Function to receive response


#### Callback Arguments

The last argument `callback` receives three arguments: `err`, `data` and `meta`.

* When an error occurs `err` is an instance of `Error` and `data` is _null_.
`err` can have additional properties.

* When everything is good `err` will be _null_ and `data` will be the parsed result.

	* DELETE result `data` is _true_ on success, _false_ otherwise.

	* Named objects are trimmed, for example the domains list:

```js
// API response (array > object > object)
[{
  domain: {
    name: 'one.tld',
    id: 92039
  }
}]

// Module data (array > object)
[{
  name: 'one.tld',
  id: 92039
}]
```

* The `meta` parameter is always available and contains extra information from
the API, such as statusCode, request_id, runtime and twoFactorToken.


#### Errors

The `err.message` can be any of these:


message             | description
--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
credentials missing | No authentication details set
connection dropped  | Connection was closed too early
not json            | Invalid API response, see `err.code` and `err.data`
API error           | The API returned an error, see `err.code` and `err.data`
request timeout     | The request took too long
request failed      | The request cannot be made, see `err.error`
